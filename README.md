Hi, when it comes to summarization models, there are different recommendations, some prefer BERT, some GPT2 and GPT3 while few prefer XLNet
This colab notebook is simple implementation of all these 3 models so that you can easily test out, have a POC and then move ahead with whichever suits you fine. 
Kindly maintain the versions of library mentioned in the notebook else you might see version incompatibility issue with spacy thinc

I will also be publishing Pegasus model simple implementation(huggingface transformers) so that this can be used to your first step in detailed exploration of your NLP tasks
